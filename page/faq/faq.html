                King was raised as a Methodist and attended church regularly in
                his youth. He no longer attends church, but he does believe in
                God and reads the Bible. Tabitha, his wife, was raised as a
                Catholic.

                He gets his ideas from everywhere but it all boils down to
                seeing something and adding the question "What if?" "What if" is
                always the key question.

                King did that because back in the early days of his career there
                was a feeling in the publishing business that one book a year
                was all the public would accept. It made possible for him to
                publish two books in one year. Eventually, the public recognized
                it was him because you can change your name but can't disguise
                writing style.
