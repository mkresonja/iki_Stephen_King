This was a college assignment. We were supposed to pick something we want to do when we graduate and I want to be a frontend developer.
So I decided to make a Stephen King fan page.
Technologies I was using were HTML, SCSS and JavaScript.
For writing code, I used Visual Studio Code. In there I downloaded some extensions to help me with the development:
            1. Auto Rename Tag - this extension automatically renames paired HTML tags.
            2. Live Sass Compiler - this was needed to compile SCSS files to CSS files.
            3. Live Server - was helpfull because it automatically reloads the page when I make any change and save it.
            4. Prettier - Code formatter
